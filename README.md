## 🏗️ Architecture Flow

1. **Resume Upload**: User uploads their resume via the frontend.
2. **Question Generation**: Backend sends the resume to an LLM through the Gemini API to generate 10 tailored questions.
3. **Answer Recording**:
   - User selects a question and begins video recording.
   - Live transcription is generated as the user speaks.
4. **Emotion Analysis**:
   - The recorded video is sent to the Node.js server.
   - If the Docker container for emotion detection is idle, the video is processed immediately.
   - If busy, the video is added to a processing queue.
5. **Result Delivery**:
   - Emotions detected in video frames provide insights into user responses.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 📋 Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm.
- Install Python and libraries (`DeepFace`, `Flask`, `OpenCV`).

### 🖥️ Setting Up the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install  # For frontend and backend
   ```

3. **Run the servers**:
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     node server.js
     ```

4. **Pull and run the Docker container for emotion detection**:
   ```bash
   docker pull anupunj/emotiondetectionserver
   docker run -p 5000:5000 anupunj/emotiondetectionserver
   ```

5. Access the application on `http://localhost:3000` (default for React).

## ⚙️ Docker Configuration

- **Port Mapping**: Map port `5000` for container-server communication.
- **Queue Management**: Videos are automatically queued when the Docker container is busy, ensuring seamless processing.

### Run Docker:
```bash
docker pull anupunj/emotiondetectionserver
docker run -p 5000:5000 anupunj/emotiondetectionserver
```

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The application is deployed on a DigitalOcean Ubuntu VM:
- **Frontend and Backend**: Hosted on the VM.
- **Video Processing**: Handled by Dockerized Flask containers to maintain performance.
